Song by
Ultravox

We walked in the cold air

Freezing breath on a window pane, lying and waiting

A man in the dark in a picture frame so mystic and soulful

A voice reaching out in a piercing cry, it stays with you until

The feeling has gone, only you and I, it means nothing to me
This means nothing to me
Oh, Vienna

The music is weaving

Haunting notes, pizzicato strings, the rhythm is calling

Alone in the night as the daylight brings a cool empty silence

The warmth of your hand and a cold grey sky, it fades to the distance

The image has gone, only you and I, it means nothing to me
This means nothing to me
Oh, Vienna

This means nothing to me
This means nothing to me
Oh, Vienna
