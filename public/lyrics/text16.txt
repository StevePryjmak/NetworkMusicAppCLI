Go!

It's time for training and we're getting started
It's on, you know
And we wanna see you whip and shout it
"We rock, you roll!"

They say, "Go slow"
And everything just stands so still
We say, "Go, go!"
We're ready for the fight, we know the drill

Monday mornin' and we feel defeated
Seems so long ago
Tuesday's comin', we just keep on beatin'
'Til we're in our zone

They say, "Go slow"
And everything just stands so still
We say, "Go, go!"
You're gonna see us rip into it

Just jump up, kick back, whip around and spin
And then we jump back, do it again
Ninja-Go! Ninja-Go!
Come on, come on
We're gonna do it again

We just jump up, kick back, whip around and spin
And then we jump back, do it again
Ninja-Go! Ninja-Go!
Come on, come on
And do the Weekend Whip, yeah

Wednesday mornin' and we soon discover
We gotta push our game
We slept on Thursday just to get it over
The whip's a day away

They say, "Go slow"
And everything just stands so still
We say, "Go, go!"
You're gonna see us rip into it

Just jump up, kick back, whip around and spin
And then we jump back, do it again
Ninja-Go! Ninja-Go!
Come on, come on
We're gonna do it again

We just jump up, kick back, whip around and spin
And then we jump back, do it again
Ninja-Go! Ninja-Go!
Come on, come on
And do the Weekend Whip, yeah
Yeah

They say, "No, no!"
But we don't wanna sit around no more
We say, "Go, go!"
You're gonna see us rip into it

We just jump up, kick back, whip around and spin
And then we jump back, do it again-

And then we jump back do it again
Ninja-Go! Ninja-Go!
Come on, come on
We're gonna do it again

We just jump up, kick back, whip around and spin
And then we jump back do it again
Ninja-Go! Ninja-Go!
Come on, come on
And do the Weekend Whip (the whip)
Ninja-Go! Ninja-Go!
Come on, come on, come on
And do the Weekend Whip

Jump up, kick back, whip around and spin!
